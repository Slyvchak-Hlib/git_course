Modern Talking
Cheri Cheri Lady

Oh, I cannot explain
Every time, it's the same
Oh, I feel that it's real, take my heart
I've been lonely too long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take a chance for romance, take my heart
I need you so
There's no time, I'll ever go

Cheri Cheri Lady, goin' through emotion
Love is where you find it, listen to your heart
Cheri Cheri Lady, livin' in devotion
It's always like the first time, let me take a part
Cheri Cheri Lady, like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it, listen to your heart
Cheri Cheri Lady, to know you is to love you
If you call me, baby, I'll be always yours
